A example of modular characters in response to [SnowdenWintermute](https://github.com/SnowdenWintermute/bevy-modular-characters-proof-of-concept)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbYDljqf4kg).

# Models
The models were taken from the Quaternius [Ultimate Modular Women](https://quaternius.com/packs/ultimatemodularwomen.html).  

This example uses the Adventurer, SciFi, Soldier and Witch models with minor adjustments. The original
models contain one (1) scene that loads the Armature and the meshes (head, torso, legs, and feet). Also included
is 2 models with that have most of it's content deleted, that were used by Snowden on his video.
